# TD-UnicodeText
Unicode(UTF8) Text Component for TouchDesigner


This component allows user to load in unicode(utf8) text into TouchDesigner, and use them with Text TOP and SOP. You can use your own font files as well. 


Text files are read in at once, with each line stored as a separate item in storage, empty lines are included. 


This is a very straight forward example, you can modify it to suite your own needs.
